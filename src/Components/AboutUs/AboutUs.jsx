              <p className='mpara'>McClymont has dedicated himself to Immigration Law since 1997. Graduating from Otago University with degrees in both History and Law, his legal career began in Auckland in 1997 at a large litigation and immigration firm. By 2000, he had honed his focus solely on immigration, specializing in refugee applications and appeals, along with appearances before the New Zealand High Court and Court of Appeal in immigration reviews. In 2001, Alastair founded Monk and McClymont, a two-lawyer firm in central Auckland dedicated solely to immigration matters. Transitioning to independent practice in 2005 as a barrister and solicitor, he maintained his exclusive focus on immigration law. Under his leadership, the firm expanded and operated as McClymont and Associates, a law firm now operating as a partner in McClymont Shaikh Immigration.
                When not immersed in the intricacies of the law, Alastair enjoys mountain biking, studying toward post graduate qualifications and exploring new destinations.
